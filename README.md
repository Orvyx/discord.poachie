# discord.poachie
a small discord bot for users to create their own private channel.

This bot requires [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) to be installed. All information reguarding it can be found on its repository.

#### Setup

Setup is fairly simple.
First, ensure your server has a bot channel and an AFK channel.

Run bot.py, and the bot should be functional. By default, all channel names are based on their nicknames. If a user does not have a nickname, it defaults to their full username.
